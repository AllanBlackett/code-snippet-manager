# Juno Project 5 - Code Snippet Manager


## Project Description

Create code snippets notes using React.js, and update live to a database via Firebase.

## Project objective

To show a understanding of React basic concepts (e.g. state, props, components) as well as error handling and UI design.

## Project Requirements

-   Uses React, and no jQuery
-   Uses modular components
-   Uses axios and/or Firebase
-   React 'knows' about all DOM changes (bind your inputs!)
-   this.state is never directly changed because .setState() is always used to alter state
-   App is dynamic based on user interaction (e.g. drop-down menu, search field)
-   It is clear to the user what the app does
-   App and interactions are accessible
-   Errors are handled effectively
-   Site is live on student's own URL or GitHub Pages
